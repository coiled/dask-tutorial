## Dask Tutorial by Coiled

Hands-on 1 hour sessions to learn how to scale workflows using Dask and Coiled. Each session is independent of the others, so you can choose the ones you want or come to all of them.

### Parallelize your Python Code: Futures API

In this lesson, we’ll parallelize a custom Python workflow that scrapes, parses, and cleans data from Stack Overflow. We’ll get to:
‍
- Learn how to do arbitrary task scheduling using the Dask Futures API
- Utilize blocking and non-blocking distributed calculations

By the end, we’ll see how much faster this workflow is using Dask and how the Dask Futures API is particularly well-suited for this type of fine-grained execution.

### Get Better at Dask Dataframes

In this lesson, we’ll learn some best practices around working with larger-than-memory datasets. We’ll use the Uber/Lyft dataset to:
‍
- Manipulate Parquet files and optimize queries
- Navigate inconvenient file sizes and data types
- Extract useful features with Dask Dataframe

By the end, we’ll learn the advantages of working with the Parquet file format and how to efficiently perform an exploratory analysis with Dask.
